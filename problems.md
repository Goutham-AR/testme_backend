# Current workflow
- Currently only the selected file is sent to the llm. This can be improved by also sending the files imported by the main file we are sending.
- We can also send already written test files as a blueprint
  - invoice_upload_list

# Problems with generated tests
- too much mocking
- import errors
- some functions are misinterpreted by the llm
